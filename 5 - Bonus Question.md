## Case Study #5 - Bonus Question

Which areas of the business have the highest negative impact in sales metrics performance in 2020 for the 12 week before and after period?

- region
- platform
- age_band
- demographic
- customer_type

## The total impact on sales metrics resulting from the change over the 12 weeks before and after is as follows:

Based on the chart, it is evident that the `platform` is the only `business area` that experienced a positive impact as a result of the changes in packaging during this period. Conversely, the `region` is the `business area` that showed the highest negative impact on sales metrics performance.


**Providing answers to the key business questions:**
- What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?
- Which `platform`, `region`, `segment` and `customer types` were the most impacted by this change?
- What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?  


## What was the quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020?

![sales_change2020](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/bb0b788b-b1e6-417d-ae8c-a91b711a4b2e)

The quantifiable impact of the changes introduced in June 2020 can be measured by examining the sales change (%) `four weeks before and after the packaging changes`. This analysis reveals a negative impact, with a sales change of `-1.15%`. When we extend the timeframe to `twelve weeks`, the impact becomes more pronounced, with a further decline in sales, resulting in a negative value of `-2.14%` since the packaging changes were implemented.


## Which platform, region, segment and customer types were the most impacted by this change?


*Which platform was the most impacted by this change?*
![platform2](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/097730f3-367a-4fbf-926d-7ad99729c5c3)

The impact of the change is evident when analyzing the data from different time frames. In the `4 weeks before or after the change`, both platforms show a negative impact, with `Shopify` experiencing the most significant decline. However, when we extend the analysis to `12 weeks`, a different trend emerges. `Shopify` shows a positive effect, indicating that customers now prefer to purchase products online rather than through physical retail, with retail experiencing the most substantial negative impact.


*Which region was the most impacted by this change?*
![region](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/2a409cd5-666b-4571-b554-2396d1c08aa6)

In the context of the change, the data from two different time frames reveals the extent of its impact on various `regions`. When examining the `4 weeks both before and after the change`, it's apparent that `three` out of the `seven regions` have successfully adapted to these alterations. However, in the longer-term perspective of `12 weeks`, only `Europe` demonstrates a positive and increasing change in sales (%), while the remaining `two regions` display negative sales values. 

**Segment**

This is divided into two segments: the Age-band Segment and the Demographic Segment.

*Which age-band was the most impacted by this change?*
![seg-age-band](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/00eef114-cbe2-4985-83b7-163b6ed54214)

Based on the impact `four weeks before and after the change (%)`, the chart indicates that `middle-aged` individuals experienced the most significant impact, resulting in the most substantial negative changes (%). However, when we examine the change over `12 weeks (%)`, the chart reveals a decrease in sales change (%) for the `middle-aged` age-band and an increase in the negative impact for the `unknown`, `young adults`, and `retirees` age-bands.


*Which demographic was the most impacted by this change?*  
![seg-demo](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/cdaae863-f9a2-4870-9b3f-c94625233cd7)

In terms of the immediate impact, families experienced the highest negative change. However, when considering the change over a `12-week period`, it becomes apparent that the `unknown` demographic group has been the most significantly affected.


*Which customer type was the most impacted by this change?*
![cus_type](https://github.com/kenny-ayo/Case-Study-5---Data-Mart/assets/92790075/c892e8ef-2ca8-4f39-93b5-6e91d183467b)

Both `new and existing customers` experienced increasing negative changes (%) as a result of this change. Notably, among these groups, `new customers` appear to be less affected by these changes, with a majority not significantly bothered by the packaging alterations.


## What can we do about future introduction of similar sustainability updates to the business to minimise impact on sales?

*Further recommendation will be ;*

- Consider a gradual implementation of sustainability, especially in certain regions, instead of making the changes sudden. This allows customers to adjust to the changes over time and may result in a smaller immediate negative impact.

- Focus on new customer acquisition by targeting environmentally-conscious consumers through marketing campaigns and channels where these individuals are more likely to be found. Highlight your sustainability initiatives in your marketing materials to attract more like-minded customers.

- When introducing similar sustainability updates in the future, make sure to clearly communicate the reasons behind the updates and highlight the benefits, such as environmental impact reduction, to your customers. Endeavor to educate your customers about the importance of these updates and how they may positively affect the environment.

- Before rolling out any changes on a large scale, consider conducting small-scale tests and optimizations. This will allow you to identify potential issues and make necessary adjustments before implementing changes widely.

- Keep an eye on what competitors are doing in terms of sustainability.
